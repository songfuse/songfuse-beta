```

### Verify Your Business

3. Provide business documentation

### Add Your Phone Number

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Webhook Not Working
- Check webhook URL is publicly accessible (use ngrok for testing)
- Verify SSL certificate is valid
- Ensure verify token matches exactly

### Messages Not Sending
- Check access token hasn't expired
- Verify phone number ID is correct
- User must message you first (WhatsApp policy)

### Rate Limiting
- Free tier: 1,000 conversations/month
- Each user conversation = 24-hour window
- Upgrade to paid tier for higher limits
